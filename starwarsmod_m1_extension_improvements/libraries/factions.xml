	Default Relation Ranges:
	  self:          1.0  to  1.0
	  ally:          0.5  to  1.0
	  member:        0.1  to  1.0
	  friend:        0.01 to  1.0
	  neutral:      -0.01 to  0.01
	  enemy:        -1.0  to -0.01
	  killmilitary: -1.0  to -0.1
	  kill:         -1.0  to -0.32
	  nemesis:      -1.0  to -1.0

	UI value mapping (analogously for negative values):
	  1.0       = 30
	  0.5       = 27
	  0.32      = 25
	  0.1       = 20 
	  0.032     = 15
	  0.01      = 10
	  0.0032    = 5

	  -0.01 to -0.099999 - factions do not trade
	  -0.1 - start to capture territory of one another

	These values are fixed. Between them, logarithmic interpolation is used. Approximate formulas:
	  uivalue = 10 * log10(relation * 1000)
	  relation = 10^(uivalue / 10) / 1000
	Between -0.0032 and +0.0032 (UI -5...+5) linear interpolation is used, and 0.00064 equates to one UI value step.

	Note: Relations defined here apply only to gamestart. Relations may change through gameplay and/or plot.
