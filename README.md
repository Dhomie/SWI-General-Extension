# `Galaxy Reimagined submod for SWI 0.9X`
*Add numerous changes to speed up the economy, conflict aspects, amongst other QoL changes.*

*The mod is save compatible, but **back up** your save. You might end up disliking the mod, or finding a glitch.*

*The mod is unpacked, so if you dislike anything, you can change/remove these.*

### Parameter changes
* Workforce growth rate increased by 5x times.
* Ship Sale Factor penalty removed.
* Max ship order failures shown on the UI set to 0

### Combat Balance
* S shield rebalancing, no more recharge delay, but much slower constant recharge rate. Misc. adjustments so some larger shields.
* Standard Laser Turrets (RH, SL, etc. series) improvement attempts.
* Most L Turrets', (and some M Turrets' that should be L) rate-of-fire has been standardized to fire from all barrels every 2 seconds. Damage adjusted, so the DPS remains the same.
  
### AI General Changes
* Fixed rare case of Tugs attempting to deliver invalid wrecks having no scrap value.
* Expanded diplomacy event-capable factions list. This means most corporations, minor factions, and organized pirates (PIR and BLS).
* New Diplomacy Actions allowing AI-to-AI ship licence exchanges, and removals.
* Experimental change to the `expedition` logic. Max AI `expedition` goals count increased from 2 to 6, and expeditions can now target any `killmilitary` (-20 or less relations) factions.

### Economy Changes
* Most ware production cycles have been sped up by 3x times on average.
* Most wares' cargo sizes have been reduced.
* Overhauled Heavy Concussion Missile's recipe.
* Re-added the X4 Generic S/M Fabrication/Maintenance modules.
* Ship Fab/Maint modules (excluding the XXL Maint) no longer claim sectors. You'll need an Admin, or Golan XXL Maintenance module for that.
* Workforce upkeep has been increased. Cycle time changed from every 600 seconds to 360.
* Some factions can build more ships: MCS -> Arquitens | ICG -> Geonosian Frigate | Kuat -> Dreadnought Cruiser | Kamino -> Katana Dreadnought | Sienar -> VSD2, Vindicator | INC -> Defender Corvette | IMP/ASC -> Harbor Auxiliary
* Changes to loot drop rates for better mod crafting.
* Various AI station plan changes both for optimization, and war balancing.
* Loadout rule changes, the AI now has better drone allocation (ie. Repair Drones), and spends more resources on their ships to equip them with deployables and such.
* Some equipment mods have been improved.
* Various other improvements.

### AI Jobs Overhaul
* Reduced economic ship counts in general, since the better logistics makes them excess.
* Various misc. job counts (ie. S couriers, scouts) have been reduced to the bare minimum.
* Economic ship subordinates removed (existing ships will keep/restock them until the job needs to be rebuilt).
* Combat jobs fleet compositions have been reworked, optimized. Pool of pickable ships expanded in general (ie. IMP and ASC have a chance to pick better TIE variants).
* Added extra job tags to fleets, so the AI can use more for expeditions and invasions.
* Due to the reworked economy, despite the total ship count reduction, more ships might exist at once than in base SWI.
* Adjusted some non-Crisis Sith jobs to be more active for expansion
